# Introduction
## concurrency vs. parallelism
you may think concurreny and parallelism are two terms that actually means the same thing
It is not accurate
concurrency and parallelism are indeed similar, but NOT identical!

Say you want to order pizza and ice cream for a party in you house and the pizza and the ice cream are sold in separate stores

single threaded attitude would say:
1. call the pizza store
2. wait in the queue ("dead time")
3. order pizza
4. call the ice cream store
5. wait in the queue ("dead time")
6. order ice cream
